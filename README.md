🔍 Stock Movement Prediction 📊🎯

Today, I'm sharing my indicator that I created using python, yahoo finance, and matplotlib! 🎉

In this study, the purpose of my indicator is to send us signals when the stock movement crosses the Bollinger middle band and also crosses the RSI 50 value.

In July, my indicator suggested 4 trades and I tried all of them on Türk Traktör stock signals:

July 3, 13:30 - BUY. 
July 5, 10:30 - SELL 
July 12 13:30 - SELL

we kept our first trade open until the second signal and made a profit of 2.38%
I still haven't closed the second transaction and it's now down 9.36%. 

According to my July analysis, if we had used the indicator on the EURUSD pair, we would have made a 122% profit on one trade between July 2nd and July 8th alone.

ENTRY: 1.07161
TP: 1.08359 (July 8, 10:00)
SL: 1.06851
